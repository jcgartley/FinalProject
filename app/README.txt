This app is a way to store a list of the books you want to read.
Books are stored and identified by title, but can also store information
on the author, the genre of the book (up to 2), and can autogenerate a summary
if the book has a Wikipedia page.  Users can view all their to-be-read books
or all to-be-reads and completed books.
